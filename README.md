# Pre-trained models for the follow object controller of NeurIPS 2020 paper with id 1001

This repository includes the weight files of the pre-trained neural networks for the follow object controller of the NeurIPS paper with ID 1001. The code for the follow object controller is submitted in the *constraintnet_foc* repository as a part of the supplementary material (zip file). The *constraintnet_foc* repository does not contain the weight files due to the limited size of the supplementary material. For
using the weight files in the submitted code repository, replace the */experiments* directory of the *constraintnet_foc* repository with the */experiments* directory of this repository.
